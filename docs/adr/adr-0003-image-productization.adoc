# Productization of the container scanner image

## Context and Problem Statement

In the context of integrating the container scanner in the OpenShift Insights Operator, the container scanner must be delivered as a container image that is pulled and available by default in OpenShift installations so tha the Insights Operator can create the appropriate resources to extract runtime information from OpenShift workload.

It is integrated and delivered within the OpenShift Insights Operator. The location of the image and its maintenance should match those of the operator.

## Considered Options

### Container Registry

As the container scanner is integrated in the OpenShift Insights Operator, it must be available in a container registry to be pulled and included in default OpenShift installations.
The container image for the OpenShift Insights Operator is pushed to https://quay.io/repository/openshift/origin-insights-operator[quay.io/openshift/origin-insights-operator].

As the container scanner capabilities are tied to the Insights Operator, it makes sense to keep the container scanner image colocated to it.

Other options would be to push it to another quay.io organization unrelated to quay.io/openshift but this would complicate the integration, releases and maintenance of the container scanner that should be maintained as part of OpenShift releases.

### Source code

In order to be integrated and delivered with OpenShift, it must be a public project.
As the container scanner is tied to the Insights Operator (whose source code is at https://github.com/openshift/insights-operator/), it makes sense to keep its source code under the same organization umbrella with a name matching its purpose.

Making it available at https://github.com/openshift/insights-runtime-extractor ensures that it is properly identified and handled as a component of OpenShift.

### Build Pipeline

As this is a new image that needs to be productized, it is expected to be build on Konflux instead of legacy image building pipelines. 

This decisions relies on the capabilities for Konflux to build images based on Rust and Go.

## Decision

The container scanner source code is located at https://github.com/openshift/insights-runtime-extractor.
It is built using Konflux and pushed to https://quay.io/repository/openshift/origin-insights-runtime-extractor[quay.io/openshift/origin-insights-runtime-extractor].

It is be integrated in OpenShift in the same fashion that the Insights Operator through OCP ART.

## Consequences

The maintenance and development of the container scanner is tied and integrated into the OpenShift Insights Operator releases.

Issue management must comply to the OpenShift Container Platform issue tracker. It can be under the https://issues.redhat.com/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20OCPBUGS%20AND%20component%20%3D%20%22Insights%20Operator%22[existing component for the Insights Operator] as it is ultimately the component that delivers its capabilities.
