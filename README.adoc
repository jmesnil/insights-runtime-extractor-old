# OpenSight Insights Runtime Extractor
:toc:

## Gather runtime workload informations

The container images built from this project provides an `insights-runtime-extractor`
feature integrated to the https://github.com/openshift/insights-operator/tree/master[OpenShift Insights Operator].

The request for enhancement for this feature was created at https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1584.

The container images are built by a GitHub action and published to:

* `ghcr.io/jmesnil/insights-runtime-extractor:latest`
* `ghcr.io/jmesnil/insights-runtime-exporter:latest`

## Build the container images

[source,bash]
----
make build-image
----

It builds 2 multi-arch (ARM64 & AMD64) images:

* `quay.io/jmesnil/insights-runtime-extractor:latest`
* `quay.io/jmesnil/insights-runtime-exporter:latest`

To build the images in another container registry, you can use the `IMAGE_REGISTRY` env var:

[source,bash]
----
IMAGE_REGISTRY=quay.io/my-user-name make build-image
----

## Build the development image for Rust

[source,bash]
----
make build-rust-dev-image
----

This creates a `rust-dev` Container image that contains all the Rust plumbing to compile and execute the code in `extractor`

### Run the development image and compile the Rust code base

[source,bash]
----
make rust-dev

# you are then inside a container ready to compile the Rust code
make
----

## Test the container images

Prequesites:

* To test the container images, you must have access to an OpenShift cluster and
be logged in with a cluster admin account.

To run the end-to-end (e2e) tests, run the command:

[source,bash]
----
IMAGE_REGISTRY=quay.io/jmesnil make e2e-test
----

## Run the extractor

Prequisites:

* `curl`, `jq`, `oc` are installed on your machine
* you must have access to an OpenShift cluster and be logged in with a *cluster admin* account

To deploy the insights-runtime-extractor in the `default` namespace, run the commands:

[source,bash]
----
oc project default
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmesnil/insights-runtime-extractor/main/manifests/insights-runtime-extractor-scc.yaml
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmesnil/insights-runtime-extractor/main/manifests/insights-runtime-extractor.yaml
----

Verify that it is properly deployed:

[source,bash]
----
oc get daemonset -n default insights-runtime-extractor
----

It should display that all the daemonset pods are ready:

[source,bash]
----
NAME                         DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   NODE SELECTOR            AGE
insights-runtime-extractor   2         2         2       2            2           kubernetes.io/os=linux   20m
----

Once the `insights-runtime-extractor` is ready, you can extract all the runtime info by running the script:

[source,bash]
----
curl -s -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmesnil/insights-runtime-extractor/main/scripts/extract.sh | bash -s
---- 

This command will output all the extracted runtime info organized by `namespace`, `pod` names and `container` ID:

[source,json]
